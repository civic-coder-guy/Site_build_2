        And lead us not into tempation,<br>
        but deliver us from the evil one.'<br>
        <br>
        For if you forgive other people when they sin against you,<br>
        your heavenly Father will also forgive you.<br>
        But if you do not forgive others their sins,<br>
        your Father will not forgive your sins."

        <h2>Book Review</h2>
        <p>When you have been through trauma in your life your always trying to find a way to cope with or move on without forgetting.
            Its a hard thing todo. Especially when you are not sure where to look. You can go talk to someone, go to Church and try to become closer to God. 
            Everyones trauma is unique to them based off of Gods plan. There are always so many questions that run through your mind and you never get the answers you are seeking.
        </p>
        <p>This book really brought out my emotions specifically about the grief I have about the loss of my first wife. The more I read throug this book the more It for me thinking
            about the issues that I am still struggling with. This book has brought so many things I am struggling with to light that I now know what I need to do to help cope.
        </p>
        <p>Lysa TerKeurst's latest book, "Forgiving What You Can't Forget," has deeply touched me and I am filled with gratitude. 
            Her bravery in sharing not only from her personal experiences but also from thorough theological and therapeutic research on forgiveness is truly praiseworthy. 
            This resource has been a priceless asset in my own journey and I am hopeful it will bring the same healing to others. 
            Forgiveness can often feel like an insurmountable task, yet Lysa has masterfully crafted a poignant guide to navigate through the most painful parts of our past. 
            What sets her book apart is her own personal journey of forgiving, which serves as a powerful inspiration and testimony of what God can do in our hearts. 
            In my opinion, "Forgiving What You Can't Forget" is a standout resource and possibly one of the most impactful books on forgiveness.</p>
